# Useful-Scripts
A bunch of useful scripts to automate the boring stuff while doing a ctf machine.

## Usage
All details are covered [here](https://cybersecfun.pythonanywhere.com/other/useful-scripts.html).
But to spawn the quick usage guide run the script without arguments.

## NOTES
Make sure to add the location of the scripts to the `$PATH` env variable or copy the scipts to the `/usr/bin/` directory.
If you are using a regular bash termianl, make sure to replace all occurences of `.zshrc` to `.bashrc`.
